<h3>COVID-19 and Minimizing Micro-Spatial Interactions</h3>
<div id="abstract" class="section level4">
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>COVID-19, the novel coronavirus that has disrupted lives around the
world, continues to challenge how humans interact in public and shared
environments. Repopulating the micro-spatial setting of an office
building, with virus spread and transmission mitigation measures, is
critical for a return to normalcy. Advice from public health experts,
such as maintaining physical distancing from others and well-ventilated
spaces, is essential, yet there is a lack of sound guidance on
configuring office usage that allows for a safe return of workers. This
paper highlights the potential for decision-making and planning insights
through location analytics, particularly within an office setting.
Proposed is a spatial analytic framework addressing the need for
physical distancing and limiting worker interaction, supported by
geographic information systems, network science, and spatial
optimization. The developed modeling approach addresses dispersion of
assigned office spaces as well as associated movement within the office
environment. This can be used to support the design and utilization of
offices in a manner that minimizes the risk of COVID-19 transmission.
Our proposed model produces two main findings: 1) that the consideration
of minimizing potential interaction as an objective has implications for
the safety of work environments and 2) that current social distancing
measures may be inadequate within office settings. Our results show that
leveraging exploratory spatial data analyses through the integration of
geographic information systems, network science, and spatial
optimization enables the identification of workspace allocation
alternatives in support of office repopulation efforts.</p>

<h3>Urban Mobility and Segregation Examined through Networked Travel
Activity</h3>
<div id="abstract-1" class="section level4">
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>Individuals make travel decisions every day that feed into a vast
network of spatial interactions. Unfortunately for some, ongoing
economic, social, and psychological effects related to the United
States’ history of racism, segregation, and discrimination have led to
significant disparities in urban mobility across racial groups (Ray and
Preston 2009). The effect of segregation in residential neighborhoods
has been extensively studied, and more attention is being brought to
other spatial contexts in which people interact. However, comparatively
little research has taken a comprehensive approach to both segregation
and urban mobility by analyzing residential, work, and social
environments together. The utility of this approach lies in the ability
to characterize physical spaces by their potential for interaction
between racial groups, and whether or not group networks of activity
reveal the different accessibility levels of neighborhoods in an area.
This chapter seeks to address how networks and associated metrics can
help to explain broad urban mobility patterns and the differences that
exist between racial groups. In order to model urban mobility, we first
construct networks of travel activity based on race. We then derive
various network-based measures and a neighborhood-interaction potential
matrix that compares travel between neighborhoods in our study area. We
present results for the Los Angeles and Orange County area as a case
study because it has a large, diverse population and continues to be a
focus of segregation research (Johnston et al. 2006).</p>

<h3>Spatial Optimization for Planning and Decision-making</h3>
<p>Getting deeper into the nuanced field of spatial data science, I
decided to organize a session at the <a
href="http://wp1066709.server-he.de/sdss2021/">2021 Spatial Data Science
Symposium</a>, held virtually and organized by some wonderful folks in
my department’s Space Time Knowledge Organization Laboratory. I
recruited my fellow labmates (advisor: UCSB Geography professor Alan
Murray) to help me create and present a session tutorial on “Spatial
Optimization for Planning and Decision-Making,” a gentle introduction to
spatial optimization for a land management scenario. (All data is the
property of Alan Murray, and permission is needed to use the data and

<h3>The WhatEvery1Says Project</h3>
<p>I am grateful to have had the opportunity to be a research assistant
on the WhatEvery1Says project (WE1S) from 2018 to 2020. The project, led
by UCSB English professor Alan Liu and an incredibly talented group of
co-PIs and project managers from CSU Northridge and the University of
Miami, used digital humanities methods to study media discourse about
the humanities through large corpora of varying authorship:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The project concentrates on, but is not limited to, journalistic
articles in the U.S. available in digital textual form beginning circa
1981. Other materials include social media. Our hypothesis is that
digital methods can help us learn new things about how the humanities
have been portrayed in public discourse. For example, are there
sub-themes beneath the familiar dominant clichés and memes? Are there
hidden connections or mismatches between the “frames” (premises,
metaphors, and narratives) of those arguing for and against the
humanities? Where do the humanities fit among other topics in public
discussion? How do different sources (for example, mainstream versus
student newspapers) or different parts of the nation or world compare in
the way they talk about the humanities? And in what way—if to any
significant degree at all—does the media position racial, ethnic,
gender, first-generation student and other social groups in relation to
the humanities?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I primarily worked on the Social Groups team, which explored themes
related to race, gender, sexuality, and first-generation to college
status. I not only worked with the topic models synthesizing results, I
also leveraged my experience programming and making maps to create
several visualizaions (see below). Part of our work trying to find
connections between social groups and their portrayal in media led us to
explore additional methods such as word embeddings (vectorized forms of
words) to enhance our understanding of word similarity and the
significance of who says what “where.” A detailed summary of our results
can be found <a href="https://we1s.ucsb.edu/">here</a>.</p>

<h3>Generating Building Exterior Wall Material Estimates Using Google
Street View Imagery</h3>
<p>When I was working at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), I was
tasked with populating and managing a spatial database on global
building information. Sometimes we would not have building information
for parts of countries or entire countries, so I explored how we could
leverage Google Street View imagery to improve the spatial coverage of
our database. This led me to test out how to use the Google Street View
API to obtain oblique (street level) imagery, scale that to extract
thousands of labeled images of buildings based on known addresses and
exterior wall material types (leveraging ORNL access to other building
databases), and then train a convolutional neural network (CNN) to
detect “brick” or “no brick”. I did most of my API calls, labeling, and
automated file organization in Python. I implemented the CNN
architecture <a
href="http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/publis/pdf/lecun-01a.pdf">LeNet</a>,
modified some parameters, and ran the model on an ORNL Linux
machine.</p>
